# SequenceLogger

Logs when various CSL events occur, useful for discovering the sequence in which they occur.

## Build

It will automatically find your `Managed` folder so there's usually no need to manually add reference paths.

Thanks to **Kian Zarrin** for making that possible!

## Contributing

Always welcome :)
